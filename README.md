PROJECT TITLE
#DATASYNC (spreadsheet compare solution.)#

<a href="#"></a><img src="images/logo.svg" alt="" />

###BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT###
Spreadsheets are excellent tools for computing data and processing information. Existing ones
like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Smartsheet, etc. can perform from simple tasks, like basic
arithmetic, to hard tasks like visual basic applications (VBA) codes..
However, in instances where two or more worksheets, particularly ones with large amounts of
data, locating specific information like duplicates and differences can be difficult, even for the
best eye. Although existing Spreadsheet packages can detect such errors, they’ll require
formulas and low codes always, plus, users will still have to scrutinise the output themselves.
It's a laborious process that does too little to increase productivity.

###DESCRIPTION###.
In an age where we are increasingly relying on technology to boost productivity, being able to
spot duplicates and find other specific Information in a large pool of data within spreadsheets, at
the tap of a single button becomes a necessity. A tool like this gives data and information
professionals a great advantage, and competitive edge.
Which is where our solution comes in.
Please say hello to DATASYNC.
DATASYNC is a responsive web app leveraging JavaScript, Django and CSS to build a platform
that allows users to upload and compare multiple spreadsheets.
