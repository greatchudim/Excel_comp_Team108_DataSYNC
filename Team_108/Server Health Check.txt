\l+  
(to know ameyodb size)
SELECT relname, pg_size_pretty(relpages::bigint * 8 * 1024) as size, relkind, reltuples::bigint as rows, relpages, relfilenode FROM pg_class ORDER BY relpages DESC limit 10;
(to know highest consuming tables in db)

fdisk -l   (this will give you the drive paths and as underlined in red below. Each drive/hdd added to your server has a device path. Please take note of that  drive path.)
smartctl -H /dev/sda (command and the drive path above to check the health status of each disk)
